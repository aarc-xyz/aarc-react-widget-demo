### React Style Guide

* Use functional components over class components
* Use hooks for state management
* Follow React naming conventions:
  * PascalCase for component names
  * camelCase for instance names
* Keep components small and focused
* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow proper component structure:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  
  interface Props {
    // Props definition
  }
  
  export const ComponentName: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
    // Component logic
    return (
      // JSX
    );
  };
  ```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes
* Prefer template literals over string concatenation
* Use modern ES6+ features
* Add trailing commas
* Sort imports alphabetically
* Use meaningful variable names

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use Markdown
* Reference functions with parentheses: `functionName()`
* Reference React components with brackets: `[ComponentName]`
* Use code blocks with appropriate language syntax highlighting
* Keep line length to a maximum of 80 characters
* Use descriptive link texts instead of generic ones
